This is kind of just a placeholder lol

Script aims to make current Roblox look like 2016 Roblox, the only tested exploit was Synapse X but should work fine with all.

Script is FAR from complete and still has tons of issues, missing features, unstability and unoptimised code, this is a solo script that I will work on in my free time.

Things I need to look into:
- Interacting with players in the playerlist
- Pause, chat and backpack buttons on top bar
- Health bar changes colour when lowered
- Leaderstats
- Display names on playerlist in alphabetical order

(List will probably get better with more updates!)

Games made before or during 2018 will probably have the best compatibility
