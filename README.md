# What is Retrofiy?
Retrofiy aims to accurately convert any Roblox game that the script is executed in to a late 2016 Roblox client, the exact client that is being simulated is a old client I found on my old computer which was apparently last updated on the 10th of December 2016.

The end goal for Retrofiy is to be achieve high accuracy, high compatibility and be future-proofed so whenever the project gets discontinued, the code should hopefully still run fine years down the line!
