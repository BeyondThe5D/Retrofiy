Script aims to accurately simulate the late 2016 Roblox client on any Roblox game the script is executed in. The exact client that is being simulated is a client I found on my old computer which was apparently lasted updated on 10/12/2016 (British date format).

**Confirmed working exploits:**
- Synapse X
- Script-Ware
- Krnl
