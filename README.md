# What is Retrofiy?
Retrofiy aims to accurately convert any Roblox game that the script is executed in to a late 2016 Roblox client, the exact client that is being simulated is a client from the 10th of December 2016.
# Evaulation criteria (In order of importance)
1. **Survivability** - We strictly try avoid using HTTP services unless necessary and when it is used it's usually to download assets, theses assets can also be downloaded from an archive [here](https://archive.org/details/retrofiy_asset_archive).
2. **Accuracy** - We try to make this script almost 1:1 with a original 2016 Roblox client, we do tons of research and double check that research ourselves to ensure you are getting the most accurate experience possible.
3. **Game compatibility** - We try make sure that every single Roblox game the script is executed into will have no issues.
4. **Performance** - We try optimise the script as much as possible and try make it run on lower-end hardware.
5. **Exploit compatibility** - We make sure to test the script on the best exploits available to the public.
# Confirmed working exploits
- [Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to)
- [Krnl](https://krnl.place)
- [Script-Ware](https://script-ware.com) (Recommended for new exploiters)
