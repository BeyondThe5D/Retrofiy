# What is Retrofiy?
Retrofiy aims to accurately convert any Roblox game that the script is executed in, to a late 2016 Roblox client, the exact client that is being simulated is a old client I found on my old computer which was apparently last updated on the 10th of December 2016.

The end goal for Retrofiy is to be achieve as high compatibility as possible for Roblox games whilst remaining as accurate as possible to the original client, full compatibility may not be possible and certain methods in this script may stop working in the future since Roblox is constantly adapting and changing and may have to be forcefully removed sooner or later, although we do try our hardest to future-proof everything (eg: writing the CoreGUI from scratch, avoiding HTTP functions, etc).
